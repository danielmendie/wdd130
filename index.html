        <p>Hello there, my name is Daniel Marshall Mendie and I live in from Nigeria. I was born in 1996 at Calaba,
            Cross River state, Nigeria. I love
            spending time with family members and spending the rest of my day learning programming. It's exciting to
            start a new journey!</p>
